1. Test of texton histogram
2. Image annotation:
       - Where is the crate
       - Where is the handle
       - where is the logo
       - type of crate
               - crate with more colors
               - bright crate with small handle
               - dark crate with big handle
               - bright crate with big handle domain 
               - dark crate with big handle domain
       - how many bottles can be seen and where
       - crate bounding box
       - does not have a logo
       - which crate it is (candidate list)
       - crate dirty?
       
3. Crate bounding box - use Otsu of L component of image 
      - when a big white segment is found and the lower edge is a horiz line - assume that it is the crate
      - when smaller white segments are found - assume it is a dark crate and perform histogram equalisation
      - when a medium value is found - it is a crate with more colors
      - crates with big handle regions can be falsely recognized as crates with more colors
      - images with band can also be falsely recognized as crate with more colors
